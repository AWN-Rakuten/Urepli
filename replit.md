# MNP Dashboard

## Overview

MNP Dashboard is an AI-powered content automation platform designed for the Japanese market. It combines machine learning bandit algorithms with automated content generation to create, optimize, and distribute marketing content across multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube). The system leverages Google's Gemini AI for Japanese script generation, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for voice synthesis, and implements a multi-armed bandit algorithm for performance optimization based on ROAS (Return on Ad Spend).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

Alright—here’s the “cost-to-profit” playbook you can hand to the team and run. I’ll attack it from 6 perspectives (production, distribution/ads, funnel, learning/ops, partnerships, and risk/compliance), then give you a complete roadmap that’s realistic to execute and hard to beat.


---

1) Production costs (make more, spend less)

Goal: 10 streams × 4–6 posts/day each without hiring an editor army.

Levers & tactics

One-time design → infinite reuse:

Lock 6–8 FFmpeg templates (9:16, lower-thirds, captions, zoom/pan macro).

Keep all variable parts in JSON (hook, bullets, twist, cta, color_theme).


Voice cost control:

Use Google TTS (ja-JP Wavenet) with text chunking + caching. Cache identical lines (e.g., “詳細はプロフィールへ”) to GCS and re-use WAVs.

Deduplicate scripts across streams (e.g., travel & hacks may share “期間限定/注意点” phrasing).


Media cost:

Cache b-roll per stream keyword (e.g., “スマホ 割引”, “旅 夕日”), rotate via a short list before calling any API again.

Favor stills + motion (Ken Burns) when b-roll quota is low.


Throughput hacks:

Parallelize: synth voice and fetch b-roll while Gemini computes script variants.

Fail-open: if b-roll fetch fails, render a solid background with brand gradient + emoji icon pack.



What to implement now

Add a small WAV/JSON cache layer (GCS key = SHA1 of text + voiceName).

Add --max-renders-per-min on Cloud Run via queue to avoid CPU overspend.

Precompile common phrases (CTA, disclaimers) into pre-baked WAVs.



---

2) Distribution & ads (reduce spend per qualified click)

Goal: More qualified traffic at lower cost.

Levers & tactics

Platform order: Start with TikTok (fast short-term ROI) then Instagram Reels; use LinkedIn only for career/finance streams.

Creative economics: 80/20 rule—80% output are fast variants (change hook/first 3s/subtitle color), 20% are new layouts.

Dayparting: Auto-boost windows that historically return better profit (e.g., evenings for MNP, lunch for food).

Frequency caps (paid): cap impressions per arm/day to protect EPC.

Retargeting: lightweight—pixel your LP, retarget only cart-intents (e.g., clicked → 60s+ dwell on LP), not all viewers.

Organic lift: Pin best performing variants; attach “value-first” captions (benefit + micro-proof).


What to implement now

In bandit context, pass {hour, weekday}; maintain per-slot weights.

Add budget guardrail per platform/day; halt if (spend – revenue) < –¥X.



---

3) Funnel & landing page (maximize conversion from clicks you already paid for)

Goal: +20–40% conversion without increasing ad spend.

Levers & tactics

Offer rotation at edge: Always link to your LP (/offers/<stream>), not direct merchant deep link. Rotate top 3 offers server-side by EPC and eligibility (e.g., MNP credit check hints).

Pre-qual quiz (≤3 taps): “Carrier?”, “Budget?”, “iPhone/Android?” → personalize cards and disclosure.

Speed: 80+ Lighthouse mobile—inline CSS above the fold, preconnect all affiliate CDNs.

Trust microcopy: “#PR #広告 / 出典: … / 更新: <時刻> / 申込条件あり” above the fold reduces drop-off.

A/B LP sections via GrowthBook flags: hero order, “why now” block, comparison table density.


What to implement now

Add server-side EPC table (per offer) fed by affiliate postbacks; rotate offers without changing captions.

Push LP variant (A/B) from GrowthBook along with the video arm so analysis lines up.



---

4) Learning & ops (learn faster than competitors)

Goal: A closed loop that reallocates attention/budget to profit, not vanity metrics.

Levers & tactics

Reward = profit, not CTR/retention.

profit = affiliate_revenue(¥) − ad_spend(¥) per arm over the last 30–180 minutes.

Feed profit to MABWiser (Thompson Sampling) → GrowthBook weights every 30 minutes.


Cold-start policy: guarantee N impressions to new arms, then allow pruning.

Exploration budget: reserve 10–20% to test new hooks/templates daily.

Template memory: Tag every hook/template with features (e.g., “数値入り/疑問/限定訴求/絵文字”) and let the bandit learn which features drive profit by stream & hour.

Ops costs:

Auto-scale Cloud Run min_instances=0, concurrency=80; keep render ≤18s p95.

Batch TTS jobs (100 text chunks → one API call sequence) outside peak to exploit free tier better.



What to implement now

Use the n8n workflows (you have JSON) to compute profit, call /learn, update GrowthBook.

Add feature logging per arm into BigQuery (hook_type, subtitle_style, bg_theme) to enable contextual learning later.



---

5) Partnerships & payouts (get paid more for the same traffic)

Goal: Lift EPC and payment reliability.

Levers & tactics

Private bumps: After 50–100 qualified conversions, ask A8/ValueCommerce/Rakuten managers for private rates or exclusive landing pages; these can 1.2–1.5× EPC.

Exclusive codes: Unique code tracked to you improves attribution and sometimes boosts payout tier.

Diversify merchants: Keep at least 2 merchants per offer class (e.g., MNP: Rakuten/LINEMO/UQ). Auto-fallback if one program throttles.

Payment terms: Prefer monthly payouts; avoid programs with long validation uncertainty.

Compliance win-wins: Propose co-branded pages that very clearly state conditions → higher approval & fewer clawbacks.


What to implement now

Add a “payout-bump trigger” in n8n: when 30d EPC > ¥X and conversions > Y, send a templated email to AM with performance proof and proposed bump tiers.



---

6) Risk & compliance (hidden cost killer)

Goal: 0 bans, 0 chargebacks, 0 unpaid conversions.

Levers & tactics

Caption policy checks (Gemini): forbidden claims, guaranteed outcomes, sensitive categories.

Always include #PR #広告 when an affiliate link is present & “出典: <domain>”.

Ad policy lint: a pre-publish agent flags risky hooks (comparative/superlative without proof, financing terms).

Traffic quality: cut any traffic sources with high reversal rates (continuous monitoring).

Offer shelf-life: auto-unpublish videos whose core claim (e.g., “今月限定”) dated-out.


What to implement now

Add a ComplianceGuard agent node before publish; if fail → regenerate script or downrank arm for 24h.



---

Unit-economics “north star” (simple & rigorous)

Profit/arm/window = ΣPayout_yen − ΣAdSpend_yen

EPC (earnings per click) = ΣPayout_yen / Clicks

Break-even CPC = EPC × CVR (or just EPC if click→conversion is measured end-to-end)

Keep only arms with p95 profit ≥ 0 over last K windows; aggressively prune negative p95.



---

Complete roadmap (fast to execute, hard to catch)

Day 0–2 (foundation)

Lock templates (6–8). Add JP fonts.

Wire Google TTS + caching.

Render & Orchestrator live on Cloud Run; Make/n8n publish works to at least one platform.

Streams config (10), 2–3 RSS sources each; dedup/rank step done.

LP v1 with server-side offer rotation & quiz (3 taps).


Exit criteria: 10 streams can each produce 1–2 posts end-to-end on demand.

Day 3–7 (learning loop + first paid test)

Turn on PostHog + BigQuery events.

Deploy bandit microservice (MABWiser) + n8n 30-min cron updating GrowthBook.

Paid test: TikTok ¥70k / IG ¥30k across 3–6 arms.

Guardrails: per-platform cap and stop-loss per arm.


Exit criteria: automation reweights to profit within a day; LP quiz raises CVR.

Week 2–3 (scale the ROI gap)

Expand to 4–6 posts/day/stream (40–60 total).

Add feature tags to hooks/templates; begin contextual bandit (hour/weekday + features).

Negotiate private bumps for the top 2 merchants per stream; ship co-branded LP variants.


Exit criteria: EPC up 15–30%; profit/day stable with higher volume.

Month 1–2 (moat)

Add Ray RLlib or Vowpal Wabbit contextual bandits once data is richer (optional).

Introduce creative regeneration agent: if arm underperforms 3 windows, it rewrites first 3 seconds & subtitle style automatically.

Launch “Affiliate SLA monitor” (clawbacks, validation times, EPC drift) → auto-downrank risky offers.


Exit criteria: fully self-optimizing; manual ops limited to new offer intake and merchant deals.

“Ingenious but simple” moves you can do immediately

1. WAV caching + phrase bank (CTA/PR/source) → cuts TTS time/cost ~30–40%.


2. Server-side offer rotator using live EPC → instant EPC lift without touching creative.


3. Profit-only bandit every 30 minutes → drops spend on losers automatically.


4. Three-tap pre-qual quiz on LP → CVR and approval rates jump, fewer reversals.


5. AM bump triggers with automated performance email → EPC up without more traffic.


6. ComplianceGuard + shelf-life TTL → fewer policy incidents, less wasted spend on expired claims.

Concrete “do this now” checklist

[ ] Enable Google TTS; set VOICE_ENGINE=gcloud, GCLOUD_TTS_VOICE=ja-JP-Wavenet-F.

[ ] Add TTS & b-roll cache keyed by hash; store in GCS.

[ ] Ship LP quiz + server-side offer rotator (reads EPC from BigQuery).

[ ] Turn on n8n bandit cron (you have the JSON); feed profit; push weights to GrowthBook.

[ ] Set platform caps and arm stop-loss in n8n.

[ ] Create AM bump trigger workflow with templated email + performance screenshots.

[ ] Add ComplianceGuard check pre-publish; regenerate risky hooks automatically.

[ ] Schedule a post expiry task for “今月限定/今週限定” claims.


If you want, I can fold these into your existing Canvas FastAPI and n8n flows (ready-to-paste code snippets for the offer rotator, TTS cache, and ComplianceGuard prompt) so your junior can flip each switch today.
